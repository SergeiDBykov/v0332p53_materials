Those are results from a paper. 

The figures are per-observation dependence of the spectra parameters on the phase of rotation (as in fig. 4 of the original paper), but with addition of photon index, cutoff energy, normalisation of cutoffpl model and reduced chi square. 

Left side, From top to bottom:
Green histogram: iron line flux in units 10^{-3} photon cm^{-2} s^{-1}.
Blue histogram: the equivalent width of the iron line in eV
Red histogram: the optical depth of the Iron K-edge in per cents.
Fourth panel: blue, green and purple histograms are the photon index, cutoff energy (in keV) and normalisation of cutoffpl model respectively.
Black histogram: the reduced chi square value for the best-fitting spectra model.

On the top three panels the pulse profile of the flux in 3-12 keV is shown as black dotted histogram.

Right side: 
the 3-12 keV light curve of the source in 2004 outburst (as in fig. 2, panel A of the paper), with the vertical red line being the time an observation was made.



The file names are MJD_{xxx}_{yyy}
where {xxx} is the MJD of observation start and {yyy} is the observation ID. 

In groups folder there are phase-resolved analysis results for groups of observations (see text for details about groups).
