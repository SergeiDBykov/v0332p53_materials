Those are results from a paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14261). 
In pulse_profiles folder there are 3-12 keV count-rate pulse profile for all analysed observations (as in fig. 3 of the original paper).
In phase_resolved_spectra folder there are phase dependence of the spectra parameters on the phase of rotation (as in fig. 4 of the original paper).

The figure captions are in readme files in each folder.

In both folders the file names are MJD_{xxx}_{yyy}
where xxx is the MJD of observation start and yyy is the observation ID.
